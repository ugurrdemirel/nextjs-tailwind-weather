# Next.js Weather App with Tailwind CSS
This repo contains a very basic weather app written with next.js and tailwind. This project is using [CollectAPI Weather API](https://collectapi.com/) as weather data source, [PositionStack](https://positionstack.com/) as a Geocoding api.

On the project's homepage, the weather is displayed based on the user's location, while on the /[city] URL, the weather for a specific city is displayed.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
